  The following table shows with a
  <span class="align-middle">{% include "icons/tick.html" %}</span>
  which types of data you are likely to be granted access to for this
  activity, without requiring extensive work to justify that access.
  Although it is often possible for projects to access data which is
  currently marked with a
  <span class="align-middle">{% include "icons/cross.html" %}</span>
  you will likely need to pay special attention to the legal basis and
  condition for processing that data, as well as articulating the benefits
  and rationale.
